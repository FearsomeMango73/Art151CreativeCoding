Final Project
Drawing inspiration from artists we’ve viewed in class and using any of the techniques we’ve learned this semester, create a more developed project. This can be a significant expansion of a previous project, a completely new project or adding an additional software framework/JavaScript library to what we’ve covered (p5). Your project can be a game, interactive narrative, computer vision interactive “installation”, a webcam app, data driven app or a combination of any of these. It’s highly encouraged to bring your own interests and areas of study to the project.

Requirements:

You can use whatever software you want, just as long as the project adheres the following guidelines:

– Dynamic functionality: use callbacks, booleans, conditionals and interactivity (keyboard, mouse, etc.) to create a dynamic project. The key here is to use either Processing or JavaScript to trigger levels, scenes, aesthetics, etc.

– Use at least one media object (image, video or sound)

– Add an image or video of your project, description and a link to your GitHub repository on the class blog
