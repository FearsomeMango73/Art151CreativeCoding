Description of Final Project

I want to create a story generator based on user input and layering these things into a canvas.

This will bring interactive html and javascript with P5 to create a unique story each time.
I want this to reflect the Positive/ Negavtive game,
Where things appear based on trigger words used, but for a good thing and then a bad thing to happen to each scenerio.
